Note 1: Please navigate to the folder where the model_training_orchestrator.sh file is located before executing the model_training_orchestrator.sh script from shell
Note 2: Sometimes windows adds a carriage return (CR) to files which Linux distributions do not recognize. In such cases, please download and install dos2unix package (sudo yum install dos2unix) on your terminal. Once installed, convert the python files (train, serve, predictor.py, docker_setup.py, train_sagemaker.py, score_sagemaker.py, feature_transform.py) to unix format using the following command(dos2unix file_path)
